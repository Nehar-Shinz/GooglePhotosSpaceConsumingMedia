# Guide to Finding and Deleting Space-Consuming Media in Google Photos

This guide walks you through using the [Google Photos Toolkit (GPTK)](https://github.com/xob0t/Google-Photos-Toolkit) to find and delete space-consuming media from your Google Photos library. GPTK, developed by [xob0t](https://github.com/xob0t), utilizes Google Photos' web API for bulk organizing and managing media.

## Features

- **Find space-consuming media**: Easily identify large media files taking up space in your library.
- **Bulk delete media**: Quickly delete multiple items from your library to free up space.
- **API access**: Advanced users can use the toolkit's API for more powerful operations.

## Installation

To get started, you need a userscript manager for your browser. Here are some recommended options:

- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

If you're using Android, you can install [Tampermonkey on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) as it supports the required functionality.

After installing a userscript manager, [click here to install the Google Photos Toolkit](https://github.com/xob0t/Google-Photos-Toolkit/releases/latest/download/google_photos_toolkit.user.js). Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

## Usage

### Starting the Toolkit

Once GPTK is installed, simply open [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/), and the toolkit will be automatically injected at the top of the Google Photos webpage. You can now access the toolkit's features directly from the site.

### Finding Space-Consuming Media

Follow these steps to locate large media files in your Google Photos library:

1. In the GPTK interface, select **Library** as the source.
2. Use the **Space filter** and choose **SPACE-CONSUMING**.
3. To organize these items, select **Add to new album** to group all large media files in one album for easy management.

### Bulk Deleting Media

To delete multiple media items in your Google Photos library:

1. Select **Library** as the source in the GPTK interface.
2. Click **Move to trash**.
3. Finally, go to your trash and permanently delete the media to clear up space.

## Advanced Usage: Using the GPTK API

For those comfortable with JavaScript, GPTK exposes its API for more advanced functionality. You can access it through your browserâ€™s console.

Here's an example to find and delete media shared by a specific user:

```javascript
let nextPageId = null;
const ownerName = "John";
do {
  const page = await gptkApi.getItemsByUploadedDate(nextPageId);
  for (const item of page.items) {
    if (item.isOwned) continue;
    const itemInfo = await gptkApi.getItemInfoExt(item.mediaKey);
    console.log(`${item.mediaKey} is shared by ${itemInfo.owner.name}`);
    if (itemInfo.owner.name == ownerName) {
      await gptkApi.moveItemsToTrash([itemInfo.dedupKey]);
      console.log(`${item.mediaKey} moved to trash`);
    }
  }
  nextPageId = page.nextPageId;
} while (nextPageId);
console.log("DONE");
```

This script allows you to scan the library for media shared by a specific user and move those items to the trash.
